Contains scripts and dotfiles for setting up a my dev environment on a new machine.

### Usage

#### OSX
          ./osx/setup.sh

#### Ubuntu (using homebrew)
          ./linux/setup.sh

### Caveat

You are welcome to use this setup for yourselves, but just know I am very opinionated about my setup and you
might not agree with a lot of my choices. Tough bickies!
